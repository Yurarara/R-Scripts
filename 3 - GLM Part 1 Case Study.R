# This is a pseudo case study based on a real-world research experiment.
# The experiment studied the relationship of adolescents' sleep status and their
# negative emotions. The orirginal experiment sample contained 150 teenagers,
# while the following parameters were recorded.
# MOOD: a general index indicating depression to anxiety
# DBAS: Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep
# DAS: Dysfunctional Attitude Scale
# Stress: a general index indicating stress level
# SSQ: Subjective Sleep Quality
# Meanwhile, the sleeping quality is measured via SOLacti: Sleep Onset Latency,
# i.e. the time (in minutes) before falling asleep.
# In total, the higher these parameters are, the worse the sleep quality is.


# Case Study Part 1 - Standardised Z-score
# The data used in this case study is simulated based on some given standardised
# regression coefficient. This ensures the simulated data behaves as close to
# the actual data as possible.
# The source is as followed:
# B. Bei, J. F. Wiley, N. B. Allen, and J. Trinder. A cognitive vulnerability 
# model of sleep and mood in adolescents under restricted and extended sleep
# opportunities. Sleep, 38(3):453â€“461, 2015
